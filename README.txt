Add custom icon fonts to the built in Elementor icon controls

== Description ==

Enables the user to add their own custom icons to the built in Elementor icon controls and elements, thereby removing the reliance on FontAwesome and providing a better opportunity for branding with custom icon sets on your websites. Works exclusively through the use of Fontello's free icon font service. 

= Plugin Features =
 
*   Add unlimited icons to your website via Fontello font packs
*   View the icons in each uploaded pack, delete individual packs if desired
*   Use icons anywhere you would normally with the default Elementor icon selectors

Please note, this plugin requires the Elementor Page Builder to be installed and active. [Elementor is a free plugin](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/).

This plugin relies on a third party service for it's functionality provided by [Fontello](http://fontello.com). No private information is sent to their server, rather their provided webfont downloads are what's used to add fonts to this plugin.

4.  Upload the Fontello zip file to the plugins settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I do with this plugin? =

You can add your own icons from Fontello to Elementor (free and pro). From exisiting icon fonts to totally custom SVG icons, no more messing around with CSS or image elements. It's now all baked in.

= Can I upload more than one Fontello package to a single site? =

You bet! Upload as many as you like, they will all work. However, make sure you give each font a unique name (text box beside the Fontello download button).

= How do I remove Font Awesome icons from the default icon selectors, so that only my custom icons are available? =

Add this to your functions.php file in a child theme:

`add_filter('eci_drop_fa', '__return_true');`

= HELP! It doesnt work?! =

There is a small, small chance this plugin may not work on your web host. This is caused by two things generally: a mod_security rule flagging the ZIP upload, or the lack of PHP libraries needed to unzip files (ZipArchive). Here's the good news: your host can fix both of these easily. If they refuse, consider moving to a more modern host.

== Plugin Removal ==

Removing this plugin will render your custom icons to be deleted. Take care to un-select them from your icon elements prior to plugin removal.
